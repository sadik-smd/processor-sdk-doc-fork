Overview
========

The **Processor Software Development Kit (Processor SDK)** is a unified software platform for TI embedded processors
providing easy setup and fast out-of-the-box access to benchmarks and demos.  All releases of Processor SDK are
consistent across TI’s broad portfolio, allowing developers to seamlessly reuse and develop software across devices.
Developing a scalable platform solutions has never been easier than with the Processor SDK and TI’s embedded processor
solutions.

To simplify the end user experience, Processor SDK Linux AM62A installer provides everything needed as discussed below
to create the embedded system from “scratch” :

-  Platform/board-support software and configuration files for Linux
-  U-Boot and Kernel sources and configuration files
-  An ARM cross-compiling toolchain as well as other host binaries and components
-  A Yocto/OE compliant filesystem and sources for example applications
-  A variety of scripts and Makefiles to automate certain tasks
-  Other components needed to build an embedded system that don’t fit neatly into one of the above buckets
-  Reference Examples, benchmarks


Licensing
=========

Please refer to the software manifests, which outlines the licensing
status for all packages included in this release. The manifest can be
found on the SDK download page or in the installed directory as indicated below.

Release 11.01.07.05
===================

Released on Aug 2025

What's new
----------

**Processor SDK Linux AM62AX Release has following new features:**

  - First 2025 LTS Reference Release Including RT combined branch model
  - Out-of-the-Box EdgeAI Gallery App powered by QT 6.9 for seamless AI experiences
  - EdgeAI memory carveouts now supported via `k3-am62a7-sk-edgeai.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62a7-sk-edgeai.dtso?h=11.01.07>`_ in ti-linux-kernel & applied by default in the AM62A board environment via the name_overlays variable in ti-u-boot as seen in `board/ti/am62ax/am62ax.env <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-u-boot/ti-u-boot/tree/board/ti/am62ax/am62ax.env?h=11.01.07#n22>`_
  - Support for SELinux via meta-selinux with tisdk-edgeai-image
  - EdgeAI DM R5 (:file:`dm_edgeai_mcu1_0_release_strip.out`) & C7x IPC (:file:`dsp_edgeai_c7x_1_release_strip.out`) firmwares delivered via `ti-linux-firmware <https://git.ti.com/cgit/processor-firmware/ti-linux-firmware/tree/?h=11.01.07>`_
  - Linux Remoteproc driver now boots remote cores (MCU R5 & C7x) by default during Linux kernel boot time to support Low Power Mode (LPM) with EdgeAI firmwares.
  - Simplified the Yocto build process for :file:`tisdk-edgeai-image` by eliminating the unnecessary edgeai branding step - :ref:`Building the SDK with Yocto <building-the-sdk-with-yocto>`
  - EdgeAI DM R5 & C7x firmwares now default to remote endpoint 14 for consistency across Sitara AM6x platforms with Linux RPMsg userspace application - :ref:`IPC for AM62ax <foundational-components-ipc>`
  - Falcon mode through R5 SPL :ref:`U-Boot Falcon Mode <U-Boot-Falcon-Mode>`
  - Important Bug Fixes on top of Processor SDK 10.01.00.05 Release
  - Review Issue Tracker Section for the new fixes.

**Key Release References:**

  - RT Kernel : Real-Time Linux Interrupt Latency numbers here :ref:`RT Interrupt Latencies <RT-linux-performance>`
  - Support for streaming from OV2312 camera with `DS90UB954-Q1EVM <https://www.ti.com/tool/DS90UB954-Q1EVM>`_
  - How standby power mode works - :ref:`CPUIdle Documentation <cpuidle-guide>`
