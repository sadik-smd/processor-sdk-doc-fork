AM64x GP EVM Hardware Setup
===========================

The AM64x General Purpose (GP) evaluation module (EVM) is a standalone platform
for test and development to evaluate the functionality of the AM64x family of
products and develop prototypes for a variety of applications. It is equipped
with a Sitara AM6442 processor along with additional components to allow the
user to make use of the various device interfaces including industrial Ethernet,
standard Ethernet, peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe), fast serial
interface (FSI) and others to easily create prototypes, onboard display, onboard
current-measurement capabilities for power-conscious applications.

AM64x SK EVM Hardware Setup
===========================

The AM64x Starter Kit (SK) evaluation module (EVM) is a stand-alone test and
development platform that is ideal for accelerating the prototype phase of your
next design. The kit includes: wired and wireless connectivity, three expansion
headers, multiple boot options and flexible debug capabilities.The starter kit
is equipped with AM64x processor and an optimized feature-set to allow the user
to create commercial and industrial solutions using Ethernet-based, USB, and
serial wired interfaces, two Ethernet Ports for wired connectivity. Using standard
serial protocols such as UART, I2C, and SPI, the starter kit can interface with
a multitude of other devices, acting as a communications gateway.
