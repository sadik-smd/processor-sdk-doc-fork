Wakeup Sources
##############

This section talks about the multiple ways in which we can wakeup the |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| SoC from Low Power modes like Deep Sleep or MCU only.
The |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| SoC support various wakeup sources like GP Timers, RTC Timer, UART, I2C, WKUP GPIO, and I/O Daisy Chain.

The table below lists the wakeup sources supported in this SDK release and whether that source is
valid for given low power modes:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

*********************
Real-Time Clock (RTC)
*********************

It's possible to use the SoC's internal RTC to wakeup the system using the command rtcwake:

.. code-block:: console

   rtcwake

   - Show whether an alarm is set or not:
      rtcwake -m show -v

   - Suspend to RAM and wakeup after 10 seconds:
      rtcwake -m mem -s {{10}}

   - Disable a previously set alarm:
      rtcwake -m disable

   - Perform a dry run to wakeup the computer at a given time. (Press Ctrl + C to abort):
      rtcwake -m on --date {{hh:ss}}

For example, if you wish to wakeup from Deep Sleep or MCU Only mode in 10 seconds, use the command like this:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

   .. note::

      An additional :code:`-d rtc1` option is required on BeaglePlay as the SoC's
      internal RTC gets probed as rtc1

   .. code-block:: console

********
MCU GPIO
********

One of the most common ways to wakeup a system is by using some I/O activity. MCU GPIOs allow us to do this
by configuring the MCU GPIO controller as a wakeup source.
In ideal scenarios, the firmware running on MCU core is responsible for configuring MCU GPIO's as a wakeup source.
However, if the application design doesn't rely too much on the MCU firmware then
Linux can be used to configure the MCU GPIOs as a wakeup source. You can refer to the mcu_gpio_key node in
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
and use it as a template to configure the MCU GPIO of your choice as a wakeup capable GPIO.

A brief guide to configuring an MCU GPIO as wakeup:

First, we add gpio-keys as a compatible string, refer to `gpio_keys kernel documentation <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/gpio-keys.txt>`__
for details.

.. code-block:: dts

   compatible = "gpio-keys";


Set the desired pinctrl,

.. code-block:: dts

   pinctrl-names = "default";
   pinctrl-0 = <&wake_mcugpio1_pins_default>;

Setup the interrupt parent and interrupt as MCU_GPIO0,

.. code-block:: dts

   interrupt-parent = <&mcu_gpio0>;
   interrupts = <4 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

Now, under the switch node we add the following:

.. code-block:: dts

   switch {
               label = "MCUGPIO";
               linux,code = <143>;
               gpios = <&mcu_gpio0 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
               wakeup-source;
   };

#. The label is the descriptive name of the key. The string will reflect under /proc/interrupts as:

    .. code-block:: console

        root@<machine>:~# cat /proc/interrupts | grep "MCUGPIO"
        273:          0          0          0          0      GPIO  4 Edge    -davinci_gpio  MCUGPIO

#. linux,code: Keycode to emit.
#. gpios: the gpio required to be used as the gpio-key.
#. The `wakeup-source <https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/wakeup-source.txt>`__ property describes
   devices which have wakeup capability.

This indicates that gpio_keys can wake-up the system from Deep Sleep or MCU Only mode.

The reason we can easily use MCU GPIOs to wakeup the system from deep sleep is because
MCU GPIO's are in a power domain that is never really shut down. This means that this domain
stays ON even when the SOC is in deep sleep. Hence, the GPIO controller is able to act as a wakeup
source and send a wakeup interrupt to the Device Manager. To understand the role of Device Manager
please refer to :ref:`S/W Architecture of System Suspend<pm_sw_arch>`

MCU GPIO wakeup can only be tested when
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
overlay is loaded. Please refer to :ref:`How to enable DT overlays<howto_dt_overlays>` for more details.

Once the system has entered Deep Sleep or MCU Only mode as shown in the
:ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>`, wakeup from MCU_SPI0_D1 can be triggered
by grounding Pin 4 on J8 MCU Header.

********************
Main I/O Daisy Chain
********************

The main domain is powered-off when the SoC enters low power mode. This includes controllers like
Main UART, GPIO, I2C, etc. The question then arises how to wakeup the SoC from peripherals connected
to these controllers (for example main UART)? Here's where the role of I/O Daisy Chaining comes in.
At the hardware level, all the pads in an SoC have to be pinmuxed to dedicated controllers like UART or GPIO.

For example, If a key press on Main UART (which is used for Linux console logs)
were to wakeup the system from Deep Sleep then simply configuring the Main UART controller as a
wakeup source wouldn't suffice. This is because the UART controller is powered off and wouldn't be able to
register any key press as such. However, at the "pad" level we are still connected, and the pads have
a specific way to be configured as wakeup sources.

For detailed information and sequence please refer to
I/O Power Management and Daisy Chaining section in the TRM. To briefly explain,
setting the 29th bit in the desired padconfig register, allows the pad to act as a wakeup source by
triggering a wake irq to the DM R5 in Deep Sleep states.

.. note::
   |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| supports the ability to wakeup using pad based wake event ONLY in Deep Sleep or MCU Only Mode.
   During active system usage, even if the wake_enable bit is set the system will be unresponsive to any wakeup
   activity on that pad.


To demonstrate I/O daisy chain wakeup as part of |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| offering, two reference examples are provided:

#. main_uart0 is used where a key press on the Linux console can wakeup the system.
#. main_gpio is used where activity on configured GPIO pin can wakeup the system.


Main UART
=========

The way to configure UART as an I/O daisy chain wakeup, refer to the
main_uart0 node in `k3-am62x-sk-common.dtsi <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-common.dtsi?h=11.01.05>`_

.. code-block:: dts

   interrupts-extended = <&gic500 GIC_SPI 178 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                <&main_pmx0 0x1c8>; /* (D14) UART0_RXD PADCONFIG114 */
   interrupt-names = "irq", "wakeup";

Here, we chain the IRQ to the pinctrl driver using the second interrupts-extended entry.
The wake IRQ framework in Linux works in such a way that the second entry gets marked as a
wakeup source, and then the pinctrl driver is informed that the pad 0x1c8 in this case is to
be configured as a wakeup pad when system enters deep sleep.

To use main_uart0 as a wakeup source, ensure serial is a wake-irq in /proc/interrupts:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# grep wakeup /proc/interrupts
   231:          0          0          0          0   pinctrl 456 Edge 2800000.serial:wakeup

Then, run this script:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash -xe

   # Detach kernel serial console
   consoles=$(find /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.serial/ -name console)
   for console in ${consoles}; do
           echo -n N > ${console}
   done

   # Configure PM runtime autosuspend
   uarts=$(find /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.serial/power/ -type d)
   for uart in $uarts; do
           echo -n 3000 > $uart/autosuspend_delay_ms
           echo -n enabled > $uart/wakeup
           echo -n auto > $uart/control
   done

   # Configure wake-up from suspend
   uarts=$(find /sys/class/tty/tty[SO]*/power/ -type d 2>/dev/null)
   for uart in $uarts; do
           echo -n enabled > $uart/wakeup
   done


This will configure UART to act as deep sleep wakeup source, and
then a *key press* on same terminal should trigger a wakeup from Deep Sleep.

Any other pad can be chosen as per application requirements depending on which pad is required
to wakeup the system.


Main GPIO
=========

Configuring Main GPIO as an I/O daisy chain wakeup source requires a
combination of gpio-keys with chained IRQ in the pinctrl driver. The
configuration and working of these frameworks have been covered under
the MCU GPIO and Main UART sections.

The reference configuration for Main GPIO wakeup can be found under
gpio_key node in `k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05#n21>`__

Main GPIO wakeup can only be tested when
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
overlay is loaded. Please refer to :ref:`How to enable DT overlays<howto_dt_overlays>` for more details.

To use main_gpio as a wakeup source, ensure gpio is a wake-irq in /proc/interrupts:

.. code-block:: console

   root@<machine>:~# grep wakeup /proc/interrupts
   531:          0          0          0          0   pinctrl 416 Edge      WKGPIO:wakeup

Once the system has entered Deep Sleep or MCU Only mode as shown in the
:ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>`, wakeup from MAIN GPIO1_10 can be triggered
by grounding Pin 33 on J3 User Expansion Connector.

*********
WKUP UART
*********

The UART in WKUP domain is capable of waking up the system from Deep
Sleep and MCU Only modes.

In order to use WKUP UART as a wakeup source, it needs to be configured
in a generic way using the ti-sysc interconnect target module driver.
The reference configuration can be found under target-module in
`k3-am62-wakeup.dtsi <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62-wakeup.dtsi?h=11.01.05#n46>`__

WKUP UART is generally available on the third serial port
(/dev/ttyUSB2) and by default it only shows output from DM R5.

Once the system has entered Deep Sleep or MCU Only mode as shown in the
:ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>`, wakeup from WKUP UART can be triggered
by doing *any key press* on the WKUP UART terminal. No output will be
visible on the WKUP UART terminal, but Linux resume messages will be
printed on the MAIN UART terminal.


******************
USB Wakeup methods
******************

System wakeup is possible through the USB events in both Host and Device mode.

Host Mode Wakeup Events
=======================

The USB wakeup events in Host mode are described below:

Wakeup via a device connect event
---------------------------------

Follow the steps described in :ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>` to put the system in Low Power Mode via Deep Sleep or MCU only method.

Now plug in a USB device to one of the port on the board and the system should wakeup. Post wakeup, the device would show up enumerated.
This can be checked by below command before and after suspending and waking up the system.

.. code-block:: console

  # lsusb -t

Wakeup via a device disconnect event
------------------------------------

Plug in a USB device to one of the port on the board and check that the device is enumerated by executing the below command.

.. code-block:: console

  # lsusb -t

Follow the steps described in :ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>` to put the system in Low Power Mode via Deep Sleep or MCU only method.

Once the system is suspended, disconnect the USB device from the board and this should wakeup the system.
The device will not show up in list of USB enumerated devices. This can be verified by executing

.. code-block:: console

  # lsusb -t

Via Remote wakeup event
-----------------------

Use a device that supports USB suspend/resume and ensure that the USB device can suspend and resume correctly.
For a example a Logitech USB keyboard that supports suspend/resume. Follow below steps to check whether the keyboard is capable
to trigger a remote wakeup event to system.

Assuming the USB keyboard device is at /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/, enable USB autosuspend and wakeup

.. code-block:: console

   # echo auto > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/control
   # echo enabled > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/wakeup

Allow for two seconds of inactivity and check the runtime power status of the keyboard.
It should show "suspended", indicating that the keyboard has entered into suspend state.

.. code-block:: console

   # cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/runtime_status

Now press a key on the keyboard and check the runtime power status and it would come back to "active".

.. code-block:: console

   # cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/power/runtime_status

Follow the steps described in :ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>` to put the system in Low Power Mode via Deep Sleep or MCU only method.

And once in suspended state, trigger system wakeup via remote wakeup event by typing keys on the keyboard. The system would wakeup.
And USB keyboard would still be present in the system's list of USB enumerated devices and this can be verified by executing

.. code-block:: console

   # lsusb -t

Device Mode Wakeup Events
=========================

Wakeup via connect event
------------------------

Load a USB gadget driver such as g_zero

.. code-block:: console

   # modprobe g_zero

Follow the steps described in :ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>` to put the system in Low Power Mode via Deep Sleep or MCU only method.

Once the system has entered the suspend state, plug a cable from a different Host system to the board's USB DRP port.
This should wakeup the system and gadget will be enumerated on the Host. Enumeration of the gadget on the Host system can be verified by executing the
below command on the Host system

.. code-block:: console

   HOST:~$ lsusb -t


********************
MCU IPC based Wakeup
********************

It's possible to use IPC based wakeup events from the MCU core. For details on how to implement this
from the firmware side, please refer to the relevant documentation:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62X')

   `MCU+ SDK for AM62x <https://software-dl.ti.com/mcu-plus-sdk/esd/AM62X/latest/exports/docs/api_guide_am62x/index.html>`__

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62AX')

   `MCU+ SDK for AM62Ax <https://software-dl.ti.com/mcu-plus-sdk/esd/AM62AX/latest/exports/docs/api_guide_am62ax/index.html>`__

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62PX')

   `MCU+ SDK for AM62Px <https://software-dl.ti.com/mcu-plus-sdk/esd/AM62PX/latest/exports/docs/api_guide_am62px/index.html>`__

To use MCU IPC based wakeup, system should be placed into MCU Only mode
as shown in the :ref:`LPM section<pm_mcu_only>`.

Once the SoC enters MCU Only mode, the following log should be printed
on the MCU UART (in most cases it will be /dev/ttyUSB3)

.. code-block:: text

   [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Next MCU mode is 1
   [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Suspend request to MCU-only mode received
   [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Press a single key on this terminal to resume the kernel from MCU only mode

Any *key press* on the same terminal should trigger a wakeup from MCU Only
mode and the following message printed:

.. code-block:: text

   [IPC RPMSG ECHO] Main domain resumed due to MCU UART


************************
CAN UART I/O Daisy Chain
************************

It is possible to wakeup the system from CAN UART pins in all supported low
power modes. This is possible once CAN UART is configured.

To set CAN UART as a wakeup source, a pinctrl state called "wakeup" needs to be
added to the device tree. The "wakeup" pinctrl state will set the  WKUP_EN flag
on the desired padconfig register. When the WKUP_EN flag (29th bit) is set, it
allows the pad to act as a wakeup source. If CAN UART has the "wakeup" pinctrl
state defined, then the Linux mcan driver is able to switch to the pinctrl
"wakeup" state during suspend which enables CAN UART wakeup.

The mcan_uart0 and mcan_uart1 nodes in
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-io-ddr-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-io-ddr-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
can be used as a reference for enabling CAN UART wakeup.

.. code-block:: text

   &mcu_pmx0 {
        mcu_mcan0_tx_pins_default: mcu-mcan0-tx-pins-default {
                pinctrl-single,pins = <
                        AM62X_IOPAD(0x034, PIN_OUTPUT, 0) /* (D6) MCU_MCAN0_TX */

        };

        mcu_mcan0_rx_pins_default: mcu-mcan0-rx-pins-default {
                pinctrl-single,pins = <
                        AM62X_IOPAD(0x038, PIN_INPUT, 0) /* (B3) MCU_MCAN0_RX */
                >;
        };

        mcu_mcan0_rx_pins_wakeup: mcu-mcan0-rx-pins-wakeup {
                pinctrl-single,pins = <
                        AM62X_IOPAD(0x038, PIN_INPUT | WKUP_EN, 0) /* (B3) MCU_MCAN0_RX */
                >;
        };
   };

   &mcu_mcan0 {
        pinctrl-names = "default", "wakeup";
        pinctrl-0 = <&mcu_mcan0_tx_pins_default>, <&mcu_mcan0_rx_pins_default>;
        pinctrl-1 = <&mcu_mcan0_tx_pins_default>, <&mcu_mcan0_rx_pins_wakeup>;
        status = "okay";
   };

CAN UART wakeup can be tested by using either the
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
or
`k3-am62x-sk-lpm-io-ddr-wkup-sources.dtso <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/ti/k3-am62x-sk-lpm-io-ddr-wkup-sources.dtso?h=11.01.05>`__
overlays. Please refer to :ref:`How to enable DT overlays<howto_dt_overlays>`
for more details.

Once the system has entered any low power mode as shown in the
:ref:`LPM section<lpm_modes>`, wakeup from MCU_GPIO0_16 or MCU_MCAN0_RX can be
triggered by grounding Pin 11 or Pin 22 on J8 MCU Header, respectively.


********************************
Confirming the Wakeup event type
********************************

When the SoC wakes up from any Low Power Mode, the Device Manager logs the wake
reason, the pin number that triggered the wakeup, and the last low power mode
entered. This wake reason and low power mode can be queried by Linux using the
`TISCI LPM API <https://downloads.ti.com/tisci/esd/latest/2_tisci_msgs/pm/lpm.html>`__.
The wakeup pin can be found in the datasheet by converting the pin number from
hex to decimal and finding the corresponding PADCONFIG register.

This wake reason is printed as part of the Linux suspend/resume log:

.. code-block:: console

   [  249.471725] CPU3 is up
   [  249.472314] ti-sci 44043000.system-controller: ti_sci: wakeup source:0x80, pin:0x72, mode:0x1

In the above example, the wakeup source of 0x80 is MAIN_IO. The 0x72 pin refers
to PADCONFIG114. This means the cause of the wakeup event is UART0_RXD. The
mode of 0x1 is the last low power mode entered which was MCU_ONLY.
