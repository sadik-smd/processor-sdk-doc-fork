Audio
---------------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The audio subsystem present on various TI SoCs consists of two major components:

#. **Multi-channel Audio Serial Port (McASP)** - Provides a full-duplex
   serial interface between the host processor and external audio peripherals
   like codecs over industry-standard protocols like Inter-IC sound (I2S).

#. **System DMA engine** - Provides McASP with direct access to system
   memory to read audio samples from (for playback) or store audio samples to
   (for capture).

Along with the above, most TI EVMs and SKs have line input/output jack(s) wired
to an on-board codec that can convert between the analog signals and the
digital protocol supported by McASP.

Software Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the hardware components are exposed to userspace applications using the
Linux ALSA (Advance Linux Sound Architecture) framework, which allows control
and configuration of the hardware through common APIs. For more details check
the `links below <#additional-information>`__.

Within the kernel there are separate drivers for each component. For each
board a sound-card instance is created, usually using the :code:`sound {}`
device tree node, that links together various components like different McASP
instances to a codec or an HDMI bridge.

Generic commands and instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62DX')

    .. note::

        Only Audio playback with static DAC confgiuration is supported.
        Recording feature is not supported.

Most of the boards have simple audio setup which means we have one
sound card with one playback and one capture PCM.
To list the available sound cards and PCMs for playback:

.. code-block:: text

    aplay -l

To list the available sound cards and PCMs for capture:

.. code-block:: text

    arecord -l

In most cases ``-Dplughw:0,0`` is the device we want to use for audio
but in case we have several audio devices (onboard + USB for example)
one need to specify which device to use for audio:

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('General_family', 'AM335X_family', 'AM437X_family')

    ``-Dplughw:omap5uevm,0`` will use the onboard audio on OMAP5-uEVM
    board.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E')

    ``-Dplughw:j721ecpb,0`` will use the onboard audio on J721E-EVM
    board.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J784S4','J742S2')

    ``-Dplughw:j784s4cpb,0`` will use the onboard audio on J721E-EVM
    board.

To play audio on card0's PCM0 and let ALSA to decide if resampling is
needed:

.. code-block:: text

    aplay -Dplughw:0,0 <path to wav file>

To record audio to a file:

.. code-block:: text

    arecord -Dplughw:0,0 -t wav <path to wav file>

To test full duplex audio (play back the recorded audio w/o intermediate
file):

.. code-block:: text

    arecord -Dplughw:0,0 | aplay -Dplughw:0,0

To request specific audio format to be used for playback/capture take a look
at the help of aplay/arecord.   For example, one can specify the format with ``-f``,
the sampling rate with ``-r``, or the number of channels with ``-c``.
In this case, one should open the hw device (not the plughw) via ``-Dhw:0,0``.
For example, record 48KHz, stereo 16bit audio:

.. code-block:: text

    arecord -Dhw:0,0 -fdat -t wav record_48K_stereo_16bit.wav

Or to record record 96KHz, stereo 24bit audio:

.. code-block:: text

    arecord -Dhw:0,0 -fS24_LE -c2 -r96000 -t wav record_96K_stereo_24bit.wav

It is a good practice to save the mixer settings found to be good and
reload them after every boot (if your distribution is not doing this
already)

.. code-block:: text

    Set the mixers for the board with amixer, alsamixer
    alsactl -f board.aconf store

After booting up the board it can be restored with a single command:

.. code-block:: text

    alsactl -f board.aconf restore

Board-specific instructions

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('General_family')

    .. rubric:: OMAP5 uEVM
       :name: omap5-uevm-kernel-audio

    | The board uses **twl6040 codec** connected through **McPDM** for
      onboard audio and features one **Headset** connector, one **Stereo
      Line In** and one **Stereo Line Out** 3.5mm jack connectors.

    .. rubric:: User space
       :name: user-space

    To set up the audio routing on the board (Headset playback/capture):

    .. code-block:: text

        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Headset Left Playback' 'HS DAC'  # HS Left channel from DAC
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Headset Right Playback' 'HS DAC' # HS Right channel from DAC
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset Headset 4                         # HS volume to -22dB
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Analog Left' 'Headset Mic'       # Analog Left capture source from HS mic
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Analog Right' 'Headset Mic'      # Analog Right capture source from HS mic
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset Capture 1                         # Analog Capture gain to 12dB

    To play audio to the HS:

    .. code-block:: text

        aplay -Dplughw:omap5uevm,0 <path to wav file (stereo)>

    On kernels where the AESS (ABE) support is not available the **Line
    Out** can be used only when playing 4 channel audio. In this case the
    first two channel will be routed to HS and the second two will be the
    Line Out.

    .. code-block:: text

        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Handsfree Left Playback' 'HF DAC'  # HF Left channel from DAC
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset 'Handsfree Right Playback' 'HF DAC' # HF Right channel from DAC
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset AUXL on                             # Enable route to AUXL from the HF path
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset AUXR on                             # Enable route to AUXR from the HF path
        amixer -c omap5uevm sset Handsfree 11                        # HS volume to -30dB

    To play audio to the Line Out one should have 4 channel sample crafted
    and channel 3,4 should have the audio destined to Line Out:

    .. code-block:: text

        aplay -Dplughw:omap5uevm,0 <path to wav file (4 channel)>

    PGA' mixer, for instance:

    .. code-block:: text

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('J721E')

    .. rubric:: J721e Common Processor Board
       :name: j721e-cpb

    | The board uses **pcm3168a codec** connected through **McASP10 [AXR0-3 for playback, AXR4-6 for capture]**.
      The codec receives its SCKI clock from the AUDIO_EXT_REFCLK2 pin output of the j721e.
    | PLL4 is configured to 1179648000 Hz for the 48KHz sampling rate family.
    | PLL15 is configured to 1083801600 Hz for the 44.1KHz sampling rate family.
    | The board has seven stereo jacks, including four jacks for playback and three jacks for capture.
    |

    The audio channel mapping to jacks depends on the number of channels (slots) in the audio stream:

    .. code-block:: text

               |o|c1  |o|p1  |o|p3
         _     | |    | |    | |
        |o|c3  |o|c2  |o|p4  |o|p2
        --------------------------

        c1/2/3 - capture jacks (3rd is line input)
        p1/2/3/4 - playback jacks (4th is line output)

        2 channel audio (stereo):
        -------------------------
        0 (left):  p1/c1 left
        1 (right): p1/c1 right

        4 channel audio:
        ----------------
        0: p1/c1 left
        1: p2/c2 left
        2: p1/c1 right
        3: p2/c2 right

        6 channel audio:
        ----------------
        0: p1/c1 left
        1: p2/c2 left
        2: p3/c3 left
        3: p1/c1 right
        4: p2/c2 right
        5: p3/c3 right

        8 channel audio:
        ----------------
        0: p1/c1 left
        1: p2/c2 left
        2: p3/c3 left
        3: p4 left
        4: p1/c1 right
        5: p2/c2 right
        6: p3/c3 right
        7: p4 right

    For example, if the playback is opened in **8-channel** mode and **stereo** audio is
    desired on the **line output (p4)**,  then the **left channel** of the 8-channel stream should
    be placed to **time slot 3**, and the **right channel** of the 8-channel stream should be placed in **time slot 7**.

Potential issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: In case of XRUN (under or overrun)
   :name: in-case-of-xrun-under-or-overrun

| The underrun can happen when an application does not feed new samples
  in time to alsa-lib (due CPU usage). The overrun can happen when an
  application does not take new captured samples in time from alsa-lib.
| There could be several reasons for XRUN to happen, but it usually
  points to system latency issues connected to CPU utilization or
  latency caused by the storage device.
| Things to try:

-  Increase the buffer size (ALSA buffer and period size)
-  Try to cache the file to be played in memory
-  Try to use application which uses threads for interacting with ALSA
   and with the filesystem
