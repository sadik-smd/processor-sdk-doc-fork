##################
U-Boot Falcon Mode
##################

U-Boot's falcon mode on |__PART_FAMILY_DEVICE_NAMES__| bypasses the A-core SPL
and U-Boot stage, which allows for booting straight to Linux kernel after OP-TEE
and ATF.

**Normal boot flow:**

* R5 SPL -> ATF -> OP-TEE -> *Cortex-A SPL* -> *U-Boot* -> Linux

**With falcon mode:**

* R5 SPL -> ATF -> OP-TEE -> Linux

Falcon boot support is added by the ``ti-falcon`` yocto override which can be
enabled before :ref:`building the SDK <building-the-sdk-with-yocto>` as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ echo 'DISTROOVERRIDES:append = ":ti-falcon"' >> conf/local.conf
   $ # build the SDK
   $ MACHINE=<machine> bitbake -k tisdk-default-image

The following set of patches are also required since they are **not** part of the
``11.01`` SDK release:

   * `meta-ti <https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-ti/log/?h=scarthgap&qt=range&q=9601219021a43cf0c8b8d30ff6fd5f1e4bd42621...272390d0f6183ebab4d7fa81c689a35a125aebc6>`__
   * `U-Boot <https://git.ti.com/cgit/ti-u-boot/ti-u-boot/commit/?h=ti-u-boot-2025.01-next&id=80f8ea010e3ef61277b7ab94ac4aeb85499c3ca5>`__

*************************************
Changes made by *ti-falcon* override:
*************************************

ATF:
====

To meet the 2MiB alignment requirement for the Linux kernel's load address,
the ``K3_HW_CONFIG_BASE`` *(kernel address)* is modified to ``0x82000000``
and ``PRELOADED_BL33_BASE`` *(DTB address)* is modified from the K3 default to
``0x88000000``.

TI-SPL:
=======

Falcon mode makes use of a cut down variant of the tispl binary called
:file:`tifalcon.bin` with the Cortex-A SPL and its corresponding device-tree
removed. This file is deployed to the boot directory inside the root filesystem
so it can be picked by the R5 SPL at boot time.

R5 SPL:
=======

The R5 SPL loads the kernel :file:`fitImage` and :file:`tifalcon.bin` file. An
x509 certificate with TIFS keys verifies the :file:`fitImage` for falcon boot
instead of making use of signature nodes and keys present in the DT. This allows
for faster authentication since TIFS uses the security accelerator for
authentication, which is much faster than doing the same on R5 core.

This support is present alongside the standard R5 ``defconfig`` when ``ti-falcon``
is enabled due to U-Boot's :file:`k3_r5_falcon.config` fragment. This updates
the R5 memory map at U-Boot SPL stage to the following:

fitImage:
=========

The system produces the resulting :file:`fitImage` file in the boot directory
of the root filesystem. This file has its constituent binaries pre-signed with
x509 certificates. At boot time, TIFS authenticates this file, which allows for
a lower boot time compared to authenticating on the R5 core.

*******************
Extra Configuration
*******************

OSPI boot:
==========

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant not in ('AM62AX')

   For OSPI boot, the :file:`tiboot3.bin` and :file:`tifalcon.bin` files should be
   flashed to the same addresses in flash as regular boot flow but the
   :file:`fitImage` is read from the root filesystem's boot directory. The MMC
   device is selected by the ``mmcdev`` env variable for R5 SPL.

   Below U-Boot commands can be used to download :file:`tiboot3.bin` and
   :file:`tifalcon.bin` over tftp and then flash those to OSPI at their respective
   addresses.

   .. code-block:: console

     => sf probe
     => tftp ${loadaddr} tiboot3.bin
     => sf update $loadaddr 0x0 $filesize
     => tftp ${loadaddr} tifalcon.bin
     => sf update $loadaddr 0x80000 $filesize

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_variant in ('AM62AX')

   This section is not applicable for this platform.

eMMC Boot:
==========

In eMMC boot mode, the :file:`tiboot3.bin` file should be flashed to the
hardware boot partition whereas :file:`tifalcon.bin` and the :file:`fitImage`
are read from the root filesystem inside UDA. Use the U-Boot commands below
to set the correct boot partition and write :file:`tiboot3.bin` to the correct
offset.

.. code-block:: console

   => # Set boot0 as the boot partition
   => mmc partconf 0 1 1 1
   => mmc bootbus 0 2 0 0
   => # Flash tiboot3.bin to boot0
   => mmc dev 0 1
   => fatload mmc 1 ${loadaddr} tiboot3.bin
   => mmc write ${loadaddr} 0x0 0x400

For more information check: :ref:`How to flash eMMC and boot with eMMC Boot
<how-to-emmc-boot>`.

.. _u-boot_falcon_mode_fitImage_creation:

Custom fitImage creation:
=========================

Clone the `core-secdev-k3 source <https://git.ti.com/cgit/security-development-tools/core-secdev-k3>`__:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://git.ti.com/cgit/security-development-tools/core-secdev-k3

Copy the required kernel image renamed to :file:`Image` and the device-tree
renamed to :file:`falcon.dtb` inside the `core-secdev-k3` source directory.

Copy the following contents to a file named :file:`fitImage.its` inside
core-secdev-k3 source:

.. code-block:: dts

   /dts-v1/;

   / {
       description = "Kernel fitImage for falcon mode";
       #address-cells = <1>;

       images {
           kernel-1 {
               description = "Linux kernel";
               data = /incbin/("Image.sec");
               type = "kernel";
               arch = "arm64";
               os = "linux";
               compression = "none";
               load = <0x82000000>;
               entry = <0x82000000>;
           };
           falcon.dtb {
               description = "Flattened Device Tree blob";
               data = /incbin/("falcon.dtb.sec");
               type = "flat_dt";
               arch = "arm64";
               compression = "none";
               load = <0x88000000>;
               entry = <0x88000000>;
           };
       };

       configurations {
           default = "conf-falcon";
           conf-falcon {
               description = "Presigned Linux kernel and DTB";
               kernel = "kernel-1";
               fdt = "falcon.dtb";
           };
       };
   };

Sign the kernel and device-tree with :file:`secure-binary-image.sh` and create the
:file:`fitImage` by using ``mkimage``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ # inside core-secdev-k3 source
   $ ./scripts/secure-binary-image.sh Image Image.sec
   $ ./scripts/secure-binary-image.sh falcon.dtb falcon.dtb.sec
   $ mkimage -f fitImage.its fitImage

****************
Non-Yocto Users:
****************

Following are the steps to build :file:`tiboot3.bin`, :file:`tifalcon.bin` and the
:file:`fitImage` required for falcon mode:

#. For :ref:`ATF build <foundational-components-atf>`, use the following
   arguments to update the ATF's jump address for the kernel and the
   device-tree: ``PRELOADED_BL33_BASE=0x82000000 K3_HW_CONFIG_BASE=0x88000000``.

#. For :ref:`R5 U-Boot build <Build-U-Boot-label>`, use the
   :file:`k3_r5_falcon.config` fragment to enable flacon support at the R5 SPL
   stage.

#. Refer to the :ref:`fitImage creation step
   <u-boot_falcon_mode_fitImage_creation>` above for preparing a bootable
   :file:`fitImage` with an appropriate kernel and device-tree.

#. Copy the files generated to correct path on SD/eMMC as in the table below:

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 8 8 8 25
      :header-rows: 1

      * - File
        - Destination path on SD/eMMC
        - Partition
        - Description

      * - :file:`tiboot3.bin`
        - :file:`/tiboot3.bin`
        - boot (fat)
        - R5 SPL with falcon support

      * - :file:`tifalcon.bin`
        - :file:`/boot/tifalcon.bin`
        - root filesystem (ext4)
        - tispl binary without SPL for the A core and device-tree

      * - :file:`fitImage`
        - :file:`/boot/fitImage`
        - root filesystem (ext4)
        - :file:`fitImage` with pre-signed kernel and device-tree

.. note::

   The :file:`tifalcon.bin` binary is generated by default for all falcon
   supported platforms at the A-Core U-Boot build step and can be found
   alongside the existing :file:`tispl.bin` file in U-Boot build's output directory.

**********************
Boot time comparisons:
**********************

Removing A-core SPL and U-Boot from the boot process leads to ~60% reduction in
time to kernel. Saving about 1-2 seconds during boot depending on the platform.
